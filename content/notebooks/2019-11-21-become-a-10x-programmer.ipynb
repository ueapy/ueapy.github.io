    "\n",
    "Writing code that is easily testable makes for better code even before the tests are written. Your code will be broken up into managable, logical chunks. You don't need to go as far as test driven development, but think when you are writing code how you can make it easy to test.\n",

    "Good testing practices:\n",
    "- Minimise the iteration cycle: make short self contained functions that are easy to write tests for\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use desciptive names for functions `calculate_height_statistics(students)` not `do_suff(data)`\n",
    "- If your function will alter the data you pass it (ie a text file or netCDF) end it with an underscore\n",
    "- Follow style guides like [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\n",
    "- Read people's code on github\n",
    "- Try pair programming\n",
    "- Get familiar with your IDE (try [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux))\n",
    "- Learn another programming language\n",
    "- Try [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)\n",
    "- Get away from your computer. If you're stuck on a problem let your brain work on it subconciously. Go for walk, now's as good a time as ever (unless it's raining)\n"

    "One idea that really stood out for me was that of **cognitive resource**. You only have a certain amount of ability to process cognitive tasks. The more you can smooth your workflow to simplify or remove complications, the more cognitive power you can bring to bear on your task objectives. The tools and techniques Anthony talks about all contribute to lessening of cognitive leakage, making your work simpler, better organised and more coherent."
